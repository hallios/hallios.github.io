Welcome to the official page of halli0s, your one-stop solution for all your cyber security needs.

## Our Journey

Our story began when our founder, Brad Stimpson, assembled a group of dedicated, talented individuals with a passion for the rapidly evolving world of cyber security. Initially, our focus was on Capture The Flag (CTF) events where we tested and honed our skills. These competitive, challenging environments taught us to think creatively, adapt to ever-changing scenarios, and implement robust, effective solutions.

Over time, our expertise and reputation grew. Brad's vision of creating a full-scale cyber security consulting company started to take shape. Today, halli0s is more than just a group of CTF enthusiasts. We are a team of seasoned professionals, each one of us bringing unique skills and experiences to the table, dedicated to protecting your digital assets.
